    "**Part III:** What are the earliest and latest dates in our inspection data?  Hint: you can use `min` and `max` on dates of the correct type.\n",

    "**Part IV:** We probably want to examine the inspections by year. Create an additional `ins['year']` column containing just the year of the inspection.  Consider using `pd.Series.dt.year` to do this.\n",
