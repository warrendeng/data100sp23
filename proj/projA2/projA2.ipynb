    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In project A.1, you performed some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Then, you added a few new features to the dataset and cleaned the data in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Next, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll delve deeper into the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project - and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this part of the project, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Implementing a data processing pipeline using `pandas`.\n",
    "- Using `scikit-learn` to build and fit linear models.\n",

Instead of calling them manually one-by-one each time, it is best practice to encapsulate all of this feature engineering into one \"pipeline\" function. Defining and using a pipeline reduces all the feature engineering to just one function call and ensures that the same transformations are applied to all data.  Below, we combined some functions into a single helper function that outputs X and y for the first model above. Try to undestand what this function does! \n",

    "- **If you are running into memory issues, restart kernel and only run the cells you need to.** The cell below (question cell) contains most to all of the imports necessary to successfully complete this portion of the project, so it can be completed (almost) independently code-wise from the remainder of the project. The autograder will have more than 4 GB memory, so you will not lose credit as long as your solution to Question 4 is within the total memory (4GB) limits of DataHub. Alternatively, you can delete variables you are not using through `del` or `%reset -f`. For example, this will free up memory from data used for older models: `del training_val_data, test_data, train, validation, X_train_m1, X_valid_m1, X_train_m2, X_valid_m1`. Our staff solution can be run independently from all other questions, so we encourage you to do the same to make debugging easier. Note: If you need these data again after deleting the variables or reseting, you must reload them again. In addition, you must comment them out before submitting.\n",
    "- You will be predicting `Log Sale price` on the data stored in `cook_county_contest_test.csv`. We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e. if the value is 100, it is too large - $e^{100}$ is too big!)\n",

    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately - that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. But fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness, but also what fairness - and justice - means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL - a suburb in Cook County - as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: Their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n"

Which part(s) of the documentation might be difficult for nontechnical audiences to understand?\n"

Though we won't delve further into the role of transparency in the broader CCAO case study, consider its effectiveness and/or ineffectiveness: Is the system truly transparent if it's inaccessible to Cook County constituents? Do transparency measures actually bolster the accuracy of a model - or do they only affect the _perceived_ accuracy of a model? \n",
